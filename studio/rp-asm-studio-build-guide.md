# ticktrace Studio: Build Guide

A practical blueprint for building ticktrace Studio: the visual configurator and build engine for the ticktrace assembly SDK.

## What we're building

A desktop app that lets users configure, build, and flash assembly-language firmware for RP2040 and RP2350 targets without ever touching Make, CMake, or Kconfig directly. The GUI *is* the build system from the user's perspective. Kconfig is used internally as the catalog format for contributors authoring ticktrace modules.

Sibling product to Pingo. Shares the ImmyGo framework, visual language, and AI-assist patterns.

## Architecture

Five layers, each independently testable. Build them in this order.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 5 (GUI, Gio panels)                  │  Configure / Build log / Catalog source
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 4 (Project state)                    │  Selected features, target, pin maps
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3 (Build engine)                     │  Invokes as / ld / elf2uf2
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2 (Catalog parser)                   │  Parses .kconfig files, evaluates expressions
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1 (Catalog files, .kconfig)          │  Authored by contributors, ships with app
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The bottom three layers are headless and have no UI dependencies. They can be exercised from a CLI or test harness long before any window opens. This is the single most important architectural decision in the project; protect it.

## Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Go | Matches existing Amken stack; Pingo and ImmyGo are Go |
| GUI framework | Gio (via ImmyGo) | Reuse, consistency, single-binary distribution |
| Catalog format | Kconfig subset | Familiar to embedded contributors, well-defined semantics |
| Parser | Hand-written Go parser | ~500 LOC; existing libs are Python (kconfiglib) or coupled to Linux build |
| Build orchestration | Go `os/exec` + mtime tracking | Assembly graphs are shallow; no need for Ninja in v1 |
| Toolchain | User-supplied on PATH (v1), bundled (v2) | Keep v1 small; bundle GNU arm-none-eabi-* later |
| Project file | TOML | Diffable in git, editable by power users |
| Catalog distribution | Embedded via `embed.FS` | Catalog ships inside the binary; no install-time setup |

The `cmd/rpasm` headless CLI is non-negotiable. It exercises Layers 1-4 without the GUI, gives you CI testability, and gives power users a scriptable interface. Build it first.

## Phased implementation

Ship something usable at every phase. Don't build all five layers in parallel.

### Phase 0.1: Catalog parser (week 1-2)

Goal: parse a `.kconfig` file into an AST and walk it.

- Implement the lexer for the Kconfig subset you actually need: `config`, `bool`, `int`, `string`, `choice`, `endchoice`, `default`, `range`, `depends on`, `select`, `help`, `if`, `endif`, `menu`, `endmenu`, `source`.
- Skip the parts you don't need: `mainmenu`, `comment`, `option`, `prompt` (use the inline string instead), `imply`, `visible if`.
- Build the AST as plain Go structs. No reflection, no codegen.
- Implement the expression evaluator for `depends on` / `default if` / `select if`; it's a tiny boolean language: `&&`, `||`, `!`, `=`, `!=`, parens, symbol refs, literal `y` / `n` / `m` (skip `m`, you don't need tristate).
- Write golden tests against ~20 hand-crafted `.kconfig` snippets covering each construct.

Done when: you can load `catalog/peripherals/uart.kconfig` and print the resulting symbol table.

### Phase 0.2: Project state and CLI (week 3)

Goal: a working `rpasm` command that resolves a project file.

- Define the project state: target, map of symbol → value, pin assignments.
- Implement TOML load/save.
- Implement constraint resolution: given a partial state, propagate `select` chains, evaluate `depends on`, fill in defaults, flag conflicts.
- CLI commands: `rpasm validate <project.rpasm>`, `rpasm symbols <project.rpasm>` (dump resolved config).

Done when: you can hand-write a `blink-led.rpasm` TOML file and have `rpasm validate` report exactly which symbols are enabled.

### Phase 0.3: Build engine (week 4-5)

Goal: `rpasm build <project.rpasm>` produces a working `.uf2`.

- Translate resolved config → list of `.s` files to assemble (each catalog symbol declares its source files).
- Implement the toolchain wrapper: detect `arm-none-eabi-as` / `riscv32-unknown-elf-as` on PATH, run with the right flags per target.
- Generate the linker script from a template based on target memory map and selected features.
- Invoke `ld`, then a Go-native UF2 generator (UF2 format is trivial: 512-byte blocks with a known header).
- Track mtimes for incremental builds; keep a `build/.cache.json` mapping source path → hash + output path.

Done when: `rpasm build` produces a `.uf2` that boots on a real Pico 2 and blinks the LED.

### Phase 0.4: Minimal GUI (week 6-8)

Goal: the configure view from the mockup, end-to-end.

- Bootstrap a Gio window using ImmyGo's theme primitives.
- Build the feature tree component (reuse Pingo's tree pattern).
- Build the detail panel that renders based on selected symbol type (bool → toggle, int → numeric input, choice → radio group, string → text input).
- Wire up the Build button to call the Layer 3 engine in a goroutine; stream output to a status area.
- Add `present_files`-style flash action that runs `picotool load` or copies UF2 to mounted RPI-RP2 drive.

Done when: a user can launch the app, pick a target, toggle UART on, click Build, and get a UF2.

### Phase 0.5: Build log view (week 9)

Goal: the second view from the mockup.

- Tab strip: Output / Problems / Memory.
- Output: streaming append-only text view with monospace font.
- Problems: parse assembler error output (`file.s:line:col: error: ...`), present as clickable rows.
- Memory: parse `ld --print-memory-usage` output, render the segmented bar.

### Phase 0.6: Catalog source view (developer mode, week 10)

Goal: the third view from the mockup.

- File watcher on `./catalog/` directory; auto-reload on save.
- Source pane: read-only, with syntax highlighting (use a small handwritten lexer pass).
- Preview pane: same components as the user-facing detail panel, rendered from the just-parsed AST.
- Hide behind a Developer mode toggle in app settings.

### Phase 1.0: Polish and ship (week 11-12)

- Code signing for macOS and Windows binaries (Amken cert).
- Update channel: embed a version check that pings a static `latest.json` on the Amken site.
- Crash reporter that writes local logs to `~/.rpasm-studio/crashes/` and offers to open them; no telemetry.
- Sample projects bundled in the binary, accessible from a File → New from sample menu.
- Documentation site (separate effort).

## Catalog file format

Authored by you and future contributors. Lives in `catalog/`, embedded via `embed.FS` at build time so the app is a single binary.

```kconfig
# catalog/peripherals/uart.kconfig

config UART
    bool "UART"
    depends on GPIO
    select BOOT_ROM_HELPERS
    help
      Polled and interrupt-driven UART routines for the
      RP2350 PL011 controller. Adds ~480 bytes of flash
      when enabled.

if UART

config UART_INSTANCE
    int "Instance"
    range 0 1
    default 0

config UART_BAUD
    int "Baud rate"
    default 115200

config UART_IRQ
    bool "IRQ handler"
    default y

endif
```

Each module declares its source files in a sidecar `module.toml`:

```toml
# catalog/peripherals/uart.module.toml
symbol = "UART"
sources = ["uart.s", "uart_irq.s", "uart_baud.s"]
sources_if_UART_IRQ = ["uart_irq.s"]   # conditional inclusion
```

Keep `.kconfig` files small and topical: one peripheral per file. The catalog should grow horizontally (more files) not vertically (giant monolithic files).

## Project file format

User-visible save format. TOML so power users can hand-edit and version-control it.

```toml
# blink-led.rpasm
name = "blink-led"
target = "rp2350-riscv"
rpasm_version = "1.0"

[features]
UART = true
UART_INSTANCE = 0
UART_BAUD = 115200
UART_IRQ = true
GPIO = true
DMA = true

[pins]
uart_tx = "GPIO0"
uart_rx = "GPIO1"

[user_source]
files = ["src/main.s"]
```

The `rpasm_version` field is the migration anchor. When you change the catalog schema, bump this and write a migration function that upgrades old project files.

## Build engine details

The naive approach is fine for v1: full rebuild every time, no caching. Assembly builds are fast (< 2 seconds for typical projects). Add incremental builds only when users complain.

Pseudocode for the build pipeline:

```
1. Load project file → ProjectState
2. Load catalog → SymbolTable
3. Resolve(ProjectState, SymbolTable) → ResolvedConfig
   - propagate select chains
   - evaluate depends on
   - fail fast on unsatisfied constraints
4. CollectSources(ResolvedConfig) → []SourceFile
5. GenerateLinkerScript(target, ResolvedConfig) → string
6. For each source file: Assemble(source) → object file
7. Link(objects, linker_script) → ELF
8. ConvertToUF2(ELF) → UF2 bytes
9. Write UF2 to output path
```

Every step returns errors with enough context that the GUI can highlight the offending feature or source line.

## Pingo integration

The killer cross-product feature. Two integration points:

1. **Pin assignment links**: in ticktrace Studio's detail panel, pin fields show an "open in Pingo" link. Clicking it launches Pingo (or focuses an existing window) with the current pin map pre-loaded and the relevant pin highlighted.
2. **Shared pin map format**: define a small TOML schema both apps read and write. Initially just a flat `pin_name → GPIO_N` table; grow as needed.

Implement via a local IPC mechanism: Unix domain socket on macOS/Linux, named pipe on Windows. Pingo and ticktrace Studio register on startup; if the other is already running, they negotiate the handoff.

## Testing strategy

- **Catalog parser**: golden tests on `.kconfig` snippets. ~50 cases covers every construct.
- **Resolver**: table-driven tests of `(initial state) → (resolved state)`. ~30 cases covers the constraint logic.
- **Build engine**: 5-10 end-to-end golden projects that produce known UF2 hashes. Run on real hardware in CI via a self-hosted runner with a Pico 2 attached (`picotool` + a serial loopback for verification).
- **GUI**: smoke tests only. Gio's testing story is weak; don't over-invest. Manual exercise via the sample projects.

## Distribution

Single statically-linked Go binary per platform. No installer for v1; users download a zip, drag the app to Applications or run it directly.

- macOS: universal binary (arm64 + amd64), notarized, code-signed
- Windows: signed `.exe`, optional MSIX later
- Linux: tarball with the binary and a `.desktop` file; AppImage in v1.1

The whole thing should be < 20 MB before bundling the toolchain. With the toolchain (phase 2.0): ~150 MB.

## What to deliberately defer

Build features list in priority order, but do not build any of these in v1:

- Embedded code editor (open in external editor instead)
- AI-assisted feature selection (steal the pattern from Pingo once it's proven there)
- Multi-project workspaces (one project per window)
- Cloud sync of project files
- Plugin system for third-party catalog modules
- Localization (English only)

Each of these is a project of its own. v1's job is to prove the model works.

## Success criteria for v1

A user who has never seen Kconfig, Make, or a `arm-none-eabi-*` toolchain can:

1. Download and launch the app
2. Pick a target
3. Toggle four peripherals
4. Hit Build → Flash
5. See an LED blink on their Pico 2

Time from download to blinking LED: under 10 minutes. That's the bar. Everything else is decoration.
